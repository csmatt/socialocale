===========

A site to find and locals with your interests

SociaLocale was an attempt to create a site that allowed people to find others around them who shared their interests.

I'm releasing its source because I'd love to see the project succeed. 

If someone does find success with this, I'd love to be brought back in at some capacity, but it's up to you. 
At the very least, I do require that I am credited as the author (or contributing author) publicly on the page and also reqiure that I am notified of such.

The site is built with AngularJS, Django, and PostGIS
